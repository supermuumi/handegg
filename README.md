American Handegg is not football. It's handegg. For reference, see http://i629.photobucket.com/albums/uu19/Bullseye2620/633692057194761860-handegg.jpg

This Chrome extension lets you browse the web without getting all antsy when you see handegg being talked about as something else than handegg. 

## TODO - High prio

* Decipher if the page is really talking about handegg and not actual football
* Support other browsers

## TODO - Low prio

* Look into localizing the bastard. For example in Finnish "k√§simuna" sounds hilarious.
